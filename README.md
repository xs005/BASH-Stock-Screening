# BASH-Stock-Screening
Find stocks that have best linear regression results and increase potential
The BASH script will download the latest price data from Google Finance, 
and use the linear regression to find the ones which have best linearity.
The one that has larger slope might be profitable.
The two stocks I have chosen LGIH and CXSE both have good performance.
